This folder contains my Terraform notes, examples, and labs for infrastructure as code. 
I'm learning providers, resources, variables, modules, state, and AWS deployments.

## Structure

- examples/: Small IaC configs
- mini_projects/: VPC, EC2, S3 deployments
- troubleshooting/: Terraform apply/plan errors
