# Capstone Project

This folder contains the documentation for my full DevOps capstone project. 
The actual code will live in a separate repository. 
Here I'll keep architecture planning, diagrams, troubleshooting logs, and deployment strategy.

## Structure
- architecture/: Diagrams and visuals
- planning/: Requirements + design notes
- troubleshooting_journal/: Root-cause analysis
