## 📌 What This Repo Includes
- **Linux fundamentals** (navigation, permissions, processes, scripting)  
- **Networking essentials** (IP addressing, routing, DNS, firewalls)  
- **AWS architecture concepts** (VPC, IAM, EC2, S3, load balancing, serverless, monitoring)  
- **Infrastructure as Code** with Terraform  
- **Containers** using Docker  
- **CI/CD basics** using GitHub Actions  
- **Troubleshooting notes & system logs**  
- **Full cloud projects and capstone builds**
