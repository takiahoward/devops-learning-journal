# Foundations

This folder contains the core concepts I need before diving into AWS, DevOps, or automation. 
These fundamentals help me understand how computers, servers, operating systems, and networks 
actually work so I can build a strong base before moving into cloud engineering.

## What I'm Learning Here
- How computers work (CPU, RAM, disk, processes)
- Operating systems vs kernels
- Command-line mindset
- Basic security principles
- How the internet works (DNS, HTTP, TCP/IP)
- What servers are and how they communicate
- Client ↔ server models and request/response cycles

## Structure
- notes/: Explanations of foundational concepts
- diagrams/: Visuals and flow diagrams
- troubleshooting/: Early misunderstandings and clarifications

## Purpose
Everything in this folder supports the skills I’ll need for Linux, networking, cloud, 
Docker, Terraform, and CI/CD. Understanding the fundamentals makes the advanced tools 
easier and prevents confusion later on.
